## How to use the testing file :gear:

#### You can clone the directory or just download the file any way you want

```
git clone https://github.com/Jac-Zac/Programming_Lab_Exam_2022.git
```

#### Then you can run the file to test your code

If you want to test it, keep in mind that your code must be named exam.py and id should also be in a direcotry with also test.py.

### You can then decide to run it:

- By giving permission to the file `chmod +x test.py` and then `./test.py`
- By running it `python test.py`

### Results

The testing is not finished but It allows you to get a mark from 0 to 20, which tests a few essentials things.
Also keep in mind that in your exam.py you are calling the functions with by giving them the file data.csv you need to have data.csv in the same directory for it to work. Thous I would suggest commentinig out any test you are doing when running the test.py
